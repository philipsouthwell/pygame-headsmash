# Tie Slap
I am developing *Tie Slap* as a way of learning pygame, and as my first github project.

## Game Concept Features
- Control the movement of a head with your mouse
- A different head will appear floating on the screen
- Get your head moving as fast as you can, and...
- ...smash the other head!
- A score is generated based on
  -  How fast your head was moving when it hit the other head, and
  -  Whether your head hit the moving head in the exactly opposite direction
