# Tie Slap
I am developing **Tie Slap** as a way of learning pygame, and as my first github project.

## Game Concept Features
- Control the movement of a necktie with your mouse
- A random head will appear floating on the screen
- Get the tie moving as fast as you can, and...
- Hit the head
- A score is generated based on
  -  How fast the tie was moving when it hit the head
  -  How central the hit to the head was
